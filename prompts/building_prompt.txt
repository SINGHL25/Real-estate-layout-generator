# ====== Generic usage instructions ======
# Replace placeholders in braces {like this} with concrete values before sending to Gemini:
#   {area} = "6825 sq ft" or "634 sq m"
#   {floors} = 3
#   {style} = "Modern Minimal" | "Contemporary" | "Luxury" | "Eco-friendly"
#   {project_type} = "Mixed-use (commercial ground & 1st, residential 2nd)"
#   {features} = "double-height showroom, lift, parking, rooftop garden, rainwater harvesting"
# Recommended aspect ratio for profile/thumbnail: 1:1
# Recommended aspect ratio for building renders: 16:9 or 3:2 (landscape)
# Use: "ultra-detailed, photorealistic, cinematic lighting" for high realism
# Add "no text, no watermark, no logos" to the prompt if you want clean images.

Prompt:
"Highly detailed 3D cutaway/exploded view of the {project_type} building across {floors} floors showing each floor plate separated slightly for clarity.
Expose vertical circulation (stair, lift), parking, showroom volumes (double-height if applicable), and residential flats on upper floors.
Color-code program: commercial zones blue, residential zones warm beige, service cores grey. Add subtle holographic labels floating next to each zone.
Photorealistic materials, soft studio lighting, 3:2 aspect ratio."

PROMPT 5 — Interior: Showroom (Ground Floor) — Product-focused
=======================================================================
Prompt:
"Interior photorealistic render of the ground-floor showroom with double-height ceiling (if specified).
Material palette: polished concrete floor, minimal track lighting, sleek display plinths, large storefront glazing showing street life.
Add a subtle holographic info panel floating near the display showing 'Showroom - area approx {approx_area_per_floor}'.
Cinematic composition, high detail, realistic light reflections, no people or faces (or add mannequin-like silhouettes), 16:9."

# ====== Negative prompts (add to reduce unwanted artifacts) ======
# "no watermark, no text, no logos, no signature, no brand names, avoid overly stylized cartoon, avoid photoreal faces"

# ====== Suggested Gemini settings ======
# - Mode: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Imagen / Flash)
# - Aspect ratio: use 1:1 for thumbnails, 16:9 or 3:2 for building renders
# - Quality / steps: high quality / 1000+ tokens or high detail setting (depends on provider)
# - Variations: request 2–4 variations per prompt, pick the best and upscale if available
# - Guidance: "ultra-detailed, photorealistic, cinematic lighting, natural materials" (append to prompt)
# - If using user photo for conditioned renders: include "use provided photo as person subject" and ensure consent

# ====== How to use (quick) ======
# 1) Replace placeholders (e.g., {area}, {floors}, {style}, {repo_name}) with values.
# 2) Paste into Gemini 2.5 Flash Image prompt field (Gemini app or provider UI).
# 3) Set aspect ratio & quality, generate 2–4 variants.
# 4) For README/banner: use PROMPT 8 with {repo_name}.
